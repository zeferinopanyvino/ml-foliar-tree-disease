# ML-foliar-tree-disease
Intro to CNN with images
This project is intented to take a shot at a Kaggle competition about foliar diseases on apple trees.
Parapraph of project description
We have a dataset of around 2500 high resolution pictures (for train and another 2400 for tests) of apple leaves that may be either healthy, have rust of scam or a mixture of these diseases. 
## Getting Started
The idea of the project was to take a first glance of CNN in classification models.
se instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them
libraries:
*fastai :
```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

We could generate more images rotating the images and saving them like that.

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explanation for testing:
Testing with uploaded images. For deep learning techniques I could rotate the images to generate new ones due to a very small 
image sample (2400 pics) for test and train sets.

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment
Should be done on the Kaggle competition senction.
